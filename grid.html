    <h1>Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption and the Need for Power Grid Capacity</h1>
    <p>Understanding the Role of Electricity Capacity in Supporting EV Growth</p>
</header>

<div class="content">
    <!-- Section 1: Introduction -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why the Power Grid Matters for EV Adoption</h2>
        <p>The rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs) presents a significant opportunity to reduce carbon emissions and promote cleaner transportation. However, one critical factor in the success of this transition is the <strong>capacity of the electrical grid</strong>.</p>
        <p>As the number of EVs increases, so will the demand for electricity, which could strain the existing grid if not properly managed. The challenge is not only generating enough electricity but also ensuring that the power grid is capable of delivering it efficiently and reliably to all EV users.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Impact of EV Growth on Electricity Demand -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Impact of EV Growth on Electricity Demand</h2>
        <p>Electric vehicles require significant amounts of electricity to operate. A study by the <span class="highlight">International Energy Agency (IEA)</span> predicts that by 2030, the global demand for electricity for EV charging could increase by up to 5%.</p>
        <p>Without adequate upgrades to the power grid, areas with high EV adoption could face issues such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased pressure on local transformers and substations.</li>
            <li>Frequent power outages during peak charging hours.</li>
            <li>Overburdened transmission lines leading to inefficiencies.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Considerations for the Power Grid -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Considerations for the Power Grid</h2>
        <p>The following factors must be considered to ensure that the power grid can handle the increased demand from EVs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capacity Planning:</strong> Future electricity demand must be forecasted and the grid infrastructure upgraded accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Grids:</strong> Implementing smart grids with real-time monitoring can help optimize power distribution and reduce energy waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Renewable Energy Integration:</strong> Ensuring that the power grid integrates renewable energy sources like solar and wind to meet EV charging needs sustainably.</li>
            <li><strong>EV Charging Infrastructure:</strong> The availability and distribution of EV charging stations are crucial to managing the demand across different regions.</li>
        </ul>
